Hi! I am Sangram, web designer & developer at Ambivert.net. The free items I create are my side projects and **Ambivert Technologies Private Limited for Jekyll** is one of them. You can find **all the work I release for free [here](https://www.wdevops.com/category/free-themes-templates/)**. 

You have my permission to use the free items I develop in your personal, commercial or client projects. If you'd like to reward my work, I would be honored and I could dedicate more time maintaining the free projects. 

Thank you so much!
