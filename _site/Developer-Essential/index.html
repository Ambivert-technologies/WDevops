    "title": "Is Intelligence Enough",
    "body": "Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

    "title": "freeCodeCamp",
    "body": " freeCodeCamp. org’s open-source codebase and curriculum: freeCodeCamp. org is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job. Our full-stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills. Table of Contents:  Certifications The Learning Platform Reporting Bugs and Issues Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure Contributing Platform, Build and Deployment Status LicenseCertifications: freeCodeCamp. org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn. Each of these 30 projects in the freeCodeCamp. org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you’ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it. You can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp’s CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer’s development environment. Once you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you. The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people’s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people. Here are our six core certifications: 1. Responsive Web Design Certification:  Basic HTML and HTML5 Basic CSS Applied Visual Design Applied Accessibility Responsive Web Design Principles CSS Flexbox CSS GridProjects: Tribute Page, Survey Form, Product Landing Page, Technical Documentation Page, Personal Portfolio Webpage2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification:  Basic JavaScript ES6 Regular Expressions Debugging Basic Data Structures Algorithm Scripting Object-Oriented Programming Functional Programming Intermediate Algorithm ScriptingProjects: Palindrome Checker, Roman Numeral Converter, Caesar’s Cipher, Telephone Number Validator, Cash Register3. Front End Libraries Certification:  Bootstrap jQuery Sass React Redux React and ReduxProjects: Random Quote Machine, Markdown Previewer, Drum Machine, JavaScript Calculator, Pomodoro Clock4. Data Visualization Certification:  Data Visualization with D3 JSON APIs and AjaxProjects: Bar Chart, Scatterplot Graph, Heat Map, Choropleth Map, Treemap Diagram5. APIs and Microservices Certification:  Managing Packages with Npm Basic Node and Express MongoDB and MongooseProjects: Timestamp Microservice, Request Header Parser, URL Shortener, Exercise Tracker, File Metadata Microservice6. Information Security and Quality Assurance Certification:  Information Security with HelmetJS Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai Advanced Node and ExpressProjects: Metric-Imperial Converter, Issue Tracker, Personal Library, Stock Price Checker, Anonymous Message BoardFull Stack Development Certification: Once you have earned all 6 of these certifications, you’ll be able to claim your freeCodeCamp. org Full Stack Development Certification. This final distinction signifies that you’ve completed around 1,800 hours of coding with a wide range of web development tools. Legacy Certifications: We also have 3 legacy certifications from our 2015 curriculum, which are still available. All of the required projects for these legacy certifications will remain available on freeCodeCamp. org.  Legacy Front End Development Certification Legacy Data Visualization Certification Legacy Back End Development CertificationThe Learning Platform: This code is running live at freeCodeCamp. org. Our community also has:  A forum where you can usually get programming help or project feedback within hours.  A YouTube channel with free courses on Python, SQL, Android, and a wide variety of other technologies.  A podcast with technology insights and inspiring stories from developers.  A Developer News publication, a free, open source, no-ads place to cross-post your blog articles.  Join our community here. : Reporting Bugs and Issues: If you think you’ve found a bug, first read the how to report a bug article and follow its instructions. If you’re confident it’s a new bug and have confirmed that someone else is facing the same issue, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug. Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure: If you think you have found a vulnerability, please report responsibly. Don’t create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to security@freecodecamp. org and we’ll look into it immediately. We appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that might impact the integrity of our platforms and users. While we do not offer any bounties or swags at the moment, we’ll be happy to list your name in our Hall of Fame for security researchers.

It is run by a donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job. Our full-stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills. Table of Contents:  Certifications The Learning Platform Reporting Bugs and Issues Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure Contributing Platform, Build and Deployment Status LicenseCertifications: freeCodeCamp. org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn. Each of these 30 projects in the freeCodeCamp. org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you’ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it. You can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp’s CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer’s development environment. Once you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you. The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people’s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people. Here are our six core certifications: 1. Responsive Web Design Certification:  Basic HTML and HTML5 Basic CSS Applied Visual Design Applied Accessibility Responsive Web Design Principles CSS Flexbox CSS GridProjects: Tribute Page, Survey Form, Product Landing Page, Technical Documentation Page, Personal Portfolio Webpage2.

Information Security and Quality Assurance Certification:  Information Security with HelmetJS Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai Advanced Node and ExpressProjects: Metric-Imperial Converter, Issue Tracker, Personal Library, Stock Price Checker, Anonymous Message BoardFull Stack Development Certification: Once you have earned all 6 of these certifications, you’ll be able to claim your freeCodeCamp. org Full Stack Development Certification. This final distinction signifies that you’ve completed around 1,800 hours of coding with a wide range of web development tools. Legacy Certifications: We also have 3 legacy certifications from our 2015 curriculum, which are still available. All of the required projects for these legacy certifications will remain available on freeCodeCamp. org.

If you’re confident it’s a new bug and have confirmed that someone else is facing the same issue, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug. Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure: If you think you have found a vulnerability, please report responsibly. Don’t create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to security@freecodecamp. org and we’ll look into it immediately. We appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that might impact the integrity of our platforms and users.

    "body": "2020/05/18 - Fliver is an app to help you find Rickshaws easily. Simply open the app and enter your location and destination. Nearby Drivers will then see the areas of high demand and come to pick you up. You can also use the Hotspot Chat to discuss carpooling with others near you, or let others know about accidents, traffic, etc. via the Global Chat.  The entire project is open source and free of charge. There are no additional costs for Riders besides for the regular metered Rickshaw fare, and there is no commission that Drivers need to pay. Fliver is simply created to benefit Indian citizens. Check out our FAQ to learn more. This is the Rider app repository for Riders to mark their locations and notify a Driver. It is part of the Final Year Project of three Computer Engineering students.  Screenshots:   Building: Important: this project contains certain files that are encrypted due to the use of API keys, which is why it will not build directly on your machine. Please refer to ENCRYPTION. md for more information. To build and run the app on your device, do the following:  Install Flutter by following the instructions on their website.  Clone this repo to your local machine using git clone https://github. com/fliverdev/rider. git.  Replace all the encrypted files with your own as explained in ENCRYPTION. md.  Android: Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using flutter run in the root of the project directory.  iOS: Switch to the ios branch using git checkout ios. Then connect your devices/simulators and run the app using flutter run in the root of the project directory. Note: you can also run it in release mode using flutter run --release to improve performance and stability, however, debugging features will be disabled.

    "title": "Is Intelligence Enough",
    "body": "2019/01/21 - Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "
