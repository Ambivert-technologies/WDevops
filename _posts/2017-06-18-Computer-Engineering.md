<h3 style="text-align: center;">What you need to know when you opt for Undergraduate Degree in Computer Engineering ?</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Coding syntax can be taught. Coding logic can be learned only by coding. If you fear coding in the beginning you will always run away from it. All langues carry somewhat similar patterns and most of concepts are common. Books will teach you how things work but to make a system you have to figure out how to solve the problem using the code. You cant be a good Computer Engineer if you skip coding.</p>
Always first join the community you automatically learn form the conversation which take place see what people are facing problems eventually you will learn. One of the best practices which i would recommend.
